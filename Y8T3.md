## The New World Ch 19, Parts 1 and 2

The republic of England was formed on January 4 1949. The republic was to be governed by a council of 41 members. The members of the council were to be appointed yearly by Parliament. They proved to be quite good at what they were told to do and weren't corrupt. The army was dispersed to prevent any uprisings that might prove troublesome. The way this was done was by send the regiments that had the most troublesome people who wanted to overturn the existing systems of government. Cromwell was sent off to invade Ireland, along with everyone who would volunteer for the task. However, anyone who didn't volunteer was discharged without pay. Cromwell was determined to capture two towns occupied by Ormonde, Drogheda and Wexford. He went for Drogheda first.  First, he asked them to surrender. Crickets. Then he breached the wall with his artillery. Afterward he lead a series of assaults in a attempt to storm the town. On the third assault he was successful and began butchering everyone inside. They spent a total of three days murdering and looting anyone they found. And that is one reason the Irish HATE Cromwell.

## The New World Ch 19, Parts 3 and 4

Cromwell, in his diary, tried to excuse his allowing and encouraging his solders to massacre everyone at Drogheda. He claimed that it would prevent further bloodshed. He was wrong, dead wrong. The very bloody war in Ireland would continue for more than 2 years after he left. However, Cromwell was not completely without remorse. He writes about the "remorse and regret" that comes with the crimes. However, he did not let his men see his sorrow.  He was clearly trying to convince himself that there was nothing wrong with what he and his men did. One reason that Cromwell may have used to justify his actions was his hatred of popery. He also claimed to be revenging the 1641 massacre of protestant landlords.
